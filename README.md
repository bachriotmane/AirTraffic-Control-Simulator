## Features
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Easily program and simulate flights with specified departure and arrival dates, airports, and aircraft types.
- **Dynamic Flight Simulation:** Launch multiple flights with different departure dates, with simulation starting automatically on the scheduled date.
- **Realistic Speed Calculation:** For each flight, the simulator calculates the real speed based on the time difference between departure and arrival and the distance between airports.
